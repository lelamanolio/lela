	<p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a front-end developer based in Italy and currently working at <a href="https://livestory.nyc/eu/index.html">Live Story</a>.<br><br> I love to create new things and that's why at times I try to <a href="https://codepen.io/lelamanolio">draw stuff</a> with plain HTML and CSS and I love with a passion animating stuff on the web.<br>I'm obsessed with organizing my life in general, so both in work settings and in personal ones you'll find me crafting new Notion's templates and taking notes of everything.<br><br>My pronouns are she/her & I'm queer.</p>
